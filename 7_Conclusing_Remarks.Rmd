# Conclusion

In this work, we presented Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflow for robust production optimization. First, a 1-D problem case was considered to illustrate the workflow better and explain the workflow's detail. Then, the workflow was tested for production optimization of the 3-D synthetic reservoir model.

We conclude that the BO has a high potential for the problem where the objective function is expensive to evaluate. This is often the case in production optimization, where a hundred(s) of geological realizations represent uncertainty in the objective function. Compared with other commonly used methods like PSO or GA, BO tries to build a probabilistic model of objective function. This probabilistic model is used to think strategically and pick the next point for evaluation sequentially. Utilizing the probabilistic model and having a consistent policy to select the next point leads BO to need expensive forward evaluation a few times less than GA and PSO.

In this work, the main goal was to provide evidence of the applicability of BO for robust optimization. The field cases problem considered was a relatively medium dimension size.  However, given the potential benefits of workflow presented in this work, we would like to encourage researchers to apply the BO to the high-dimensional optimization problem. Future work could explore the use of BO for joint optimization of well location and well control. The joint problem will naturally lead to a high-dimensional problem.  It would be helpful to see BO performance when there are some inequality constraints (typical in placement problems) as well. Finally, on the theory side, the BO with a non-myopic policy in sequential data gathering will also lead to more efficiency in the performance of BO is worth having a look at.

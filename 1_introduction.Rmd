While developing a field, prediction of reservoir response to change in
the variable is an am important factor to have an efficient reservoir
management. The field of reservoir engineering is rich in the
development and application of full-physics numerical simulations for
forward modeling. However, the computational power needed to run such
numerical simulators most of the time is huge. Especially, the framework
of the Robust Optimization where uncertainty are considered through
multiple of geological realization (thousand or multi-thousand), the
practical applicability of such forward modeling is considerably
limited. To address this challenge, the proxy-modeling for reservoir
managemnet has emerged to reduce the cost of forward simulation. The
root of this field goes back to the work of the [@bruce1943] where the
analogy between flow of electricty in tthorugh te electrical device and
the response of the reservoir was constructed. [@albertoni2003] Proposed
the a Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) to estimate the production
from the well, where it claimed that total production at each is linear
combination of injection rates with diffusitivity filter. Building on
the work of [@albertoni2003], [@yousef2006] proposed a new procedure to
quantify communication between wells, where for each injector/producer
pair, two coefficients, capacitance to quantify connectivity and time
constant to quantify the degree of fluid storage were considered.
[@sayarpour2008] used superposition in time to analytically solve the
numerical integration in CRM. [@zhao2015](Zhao et al. 2015) articulated
that CRM models are not applicable when production rates change
significantly, mainly due to those models neglect to include intearction
of production-production and injector-injector pair well. Formulating
the model in the framework titled INSIM (interwell numerical simulation
model), it was used as efficient replacement to reservoir simulator when
history-matching phase rate data or water-cut data obtained during water
flooding operations.

Seperatley, in sake of utilization of recent advancemnet in the world of
Information technology, couple of reaserach has been don eon the
development of "Surrogate Reservoir Models" - [@mohaghegh2006] proposed
the workflow for SRM model where Fuzzy Paatern Recognition (FPR)
technology was dimensionality reduction, in both static and dynamic
parameters of the reservir . Key Performance Indicator (KPI) was used to
select the most important variable.- [@sampaio2009] tried on use of
feed-forward neural networks as nonlinear proxies of reservoir response.
A few set of rock and fluid properties were considere a input (porosity,
permeability in "x" direction, permeability in "y" direction, and rock
compressibility) where in developing the neural network model, only one
hidden layer was used. flow proxy modeling to replace full simulation in
history matching, and built the proxy with a single hidden layer
artificial neural network (ANN). To predict the oil production from the
SAGD rocess, (Fedutenko et al. 2014) [@fedutenko2014]employed the RBF
Neural Network to predict the cumulative oil production over the time
horizon of production (10 years) .

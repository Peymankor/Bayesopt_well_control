Well control optimization can be defined as given a pre-defined objective function, what are the best set of control decisions to make. The objective function is usually net present value or total oil recovery. These functions, generally rely on a reservoir simulator for the evaluation of proposed well control decision for the period of reservoir life cycle. On the other hand, the control decisions to make are usually well rates or bottom-hole pressure (BHPs). Given the objective function and decision to make to maximize the objective, the uncertainty in geological model are considered through optimizing the objective function over hundred(s) of geological realization. Known, as Robust optimization, Within RO, the geological uncertainties are represented by a set of realizations (i.e., an ensemble). The objective of RO is to find a control vector (e.g., a water injection scheme) the goal is to maximize the expected value of the objective function in contrast to deterministic case, where sources of uncertainty in geological model is ignored. Well control optimization typically poses challenges as the objective function is non-linear and non-convex, expensive to evaluate. Also, in RO setting, the optimization problem becomes computionally demanding as not one, rather many of geological models must be considered.This renders the optimization computationally expensive, if not prohibitive, in large-scale systems where (potentially) hundreds of wells are involved.

Literature of well control optimization can be viewed from two angles. In first the focus is what type of optimization algorithm have been used for this type of problem. Broadly, speaking the type of optimization algorithm could be divided two categories, gradient based and gradient-free.

[@sarma2005] applied adjoint-gradient based optimization to waterflooding problems. [@vanessen2009] optimized hydrocarbon production under geological uncertainty (in RO setting), where an adjoint-based method is used for obtaining the gradient information. The adjoint-based procedure is more efficient because it uses gradients that are constructed efficiently from the underlying simulator. However, he adjoint-based method requires access to the source code of the reservoir simulator, which is seldom available for commercial simulators, and it is computationally intensive. @chen2009 introduced the ensemble-based optimization method (EnOpt), in which the gradient is approximated by the covariance between the objective function values and the control variables. @do2013 analyzed the theoretical connections between EnOpt and other approximate gradient-based optimization methods. Having realized that it is unnecessary to approximate the ensemble mean to the sample mean as was done by @chen2009, @do2013 used the ensemble mean in their EnOpt formulation. @stordal2016 had a theoretical look at Enopt formulation and showed that Enopt is as special case of ell-defined natural evolution strategy known as Gaussian Mutation. It is special case from this perspective that that EnOpt of Gaussian Mutation without evolution of covariance matrix \$\\sigma\$ of multivariate Gaussian density.

On the other hand, gradient free methods represent a useful alternative when gradients are not available or are too expensive to compute. These methods are noninvasive with respect to the simulator, though they are usually less efficient and require a larger number of function evaluations than adjoint-gradient methods.

To reduce the computational cost associated with these optimization problems, two general approaches have been introduced. The frst set of techniques targets the fow problem. This generally entails replacing the high-fdelity fow simulation model with a lower-fdelity or reducedorder model, or with a model based on simplifed fow physics Methods based on the frst approach include the use of reduced-order numerical models (Van Doren et al. 2006; Cardoso and Durlofsky 2010; He et al. 2011; Suwartadi et al. 2015; Jansen and Durlofsky 2017), machine-learning and deep-learning-based surrogates (e.g.,'Guo and Reynolds 2018; Nasir et al. 2020; Jin et al. 2020), reduced-physics simulations (e.g., Møyner et al. 2015; de Brito and Durlofsky 2020), or simpler analytical representations such as capacitance-resistance models (e.g., Albertoni and Lake 2003; Lasdon et al. 2017). Multilevel optimization approaches, in which a 1 3 A two‑stage optimization strategy for large‑scale oil feld... sequence of upscaled (coarsened) models are applied, have also been developed (Aliyev and Durlofsky 2017).

While developing a field, prediction of reservoir response to change in the variable is an am important factor to have an efficient reservoir management. The field of reservoir engineering is rich in the development and application of full-physics numerical simulations for forward modeling. However, the computational power needed to run such numerical simulators most of the time is huge. Especially, the framework of the Robust Optimization where uncertainty are considered through multiple of geological realization (thousand or multi-thousand), the practical applicability of such forward modeling is considerably limited. To address this challenge, the proxy-modeling for reservoir managemnet has emerged to reduce the cost of forward simulation. The root of this field goes back to the work of the [@bruce1943] where the analogy between flow of electricty in tthorugh te electrical device and the response of the reservoir was constructed. [@albertoni2003] Proposed the a Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) to estimate the production from the well, where it claimed that total production at each is linear combination of injection rates with diffusitivity filter. Building on the work of [@albertoni2003], [@yousef2006] proposed a new procedure to quantify communication between wells, where for each injector/producer pair, two coefficients, capacitance to quantify connectivity and time constant to quantify the degree of fluid storage were considered. [@sayarpour2008] used superposition in time to analytically solve the numerical integration in CRM. [@zhao2015](Zhao et al. 2015) articulated that CRM models are not applicable when production rates change significantly, mainly due to those models neglect to include intearction of production-production and injector-injector pair well. Formulating the model in the framework titled INSIM (interwell numerical simulation model), it was used as efficient replacement to reservoir simulator when history-matching phase rate data or water-cut data obtained during water flooding operations.

Seperatley, in sake of utilization of recent advancemnet in the world of Information technology, couple of reaserach has been don eon the development of "Surrogate Reservoir Models" - [@mohaghegh2006] proposed the workflow for SRM model where Fuzzy Paatern Recognition (FPR) technology was dimensionality reduction, in both static and dynamic parameters of the reservir . Key Performance Indicator (KPI) was used to select the most important variable.- [@sampaio2009] tried on use of feed-forward neural networks as nonlinear proxies of reservoir response. A few set of rock and fluid properties were considere a input (porosity, permeability in "x" direction, permeability in "y" direction, and rock compressibility) where in developing the neural network model, only one hidden layer was used. flow proxy modeling to replace full simulation in history matching, and built the proxy with a single hidden layer artificial neural network (ANN). To predict the oil production from the SAGD rocess, (Fedutenko et al. 2014) [@fedutenko2014]employed the RBF Neural Network to predict the cumulative oil production over the time horizon of production (10 years) .
